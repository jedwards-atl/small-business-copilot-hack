COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE FORM
Various provisions in this policy restrict coverage. Read the entire policy carefully to determine rights, duties and what is
and is not covered.
Throughout this policy the words "you" and "your" refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations, and any other
person or organization qualifying as a Named Insured under this policy. The words "we", "us" and "our" refer to the
company providing this insurance.
The word "insured" means any person or organization qualifying as such under Section II - Who Is An Insured.
Other words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning. Refer to Section V - Definitions.
SECTION I - COVERAGES
COVERAGE A BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY
1.  Insuring Agreement 
a.  We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of "bodily
injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the
insured against any "suit" seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured
against any "suit" seeking damages for "bodily injury" or "property damage" to which this insurance does
not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any "occurrence" and settle any claim or "suit" that may
result. But: 
1.  The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in Section III - Limits Of Insurance;
and
2.  Our right and duty to defend ends when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the
payment of judgments or settlements under Coverages A or B or medical expenses under
Coverage C.
No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided
for under Supplementary Payments - Coverages A and B. 
b.  This insurance applies to "bodily injury" and "property damage" only if: 
1.  The "bodily injury" or "property damage" is caused by an "occurrence" that takes place in the
"coverage territory";
2.  The "bodily injury" or "property damage" occurs during the policy period; and
3.  Prior to the policy period, no insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II - Who Is An Insured
and no "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim, knew
that the "bodily injury" or "property damage" had occurred, in whole or in part. If such a listed
insured or authorized "employee" knew, prior to the policy period, that the "bodily injury" or
"property damage" occurred, then any continuation, change or resumption of such "bodily injury"
or "property damage" during or after the policy period will be deemed to have been known prior to
the policy period.
c.  "Bodily injury" or "property damage" which occurs during the policy period and was not, prior to the policy
period, known to have occurred by any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II - Who Is An Insured
or any "employee" authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim, includes any
continuation, change or resumption of that "bodily injury" or "property damage" after the end of the policy
period. 
d.  "Bodily injury" or "property damage" will be deemed to have been known to have occurred at the earliest
time when any insured listed under Paragraph 1. of Section II - Who Is An Insured or any "employee"
authorized by you to give or receive notice of an "occurrence" or claim: 
1.  Reports all, or any part, of the "bodily injury" or "property damage" to us or any other insurer;
2.  Receives a written or verbal demand or claim for damages because of the "bodily injury" or
"property damage"; or
3.  Becomes aware by any other means that "bodily injury" or "property damage" has occurred or has
begun to occur.

e.  Damages because of "bodily injury" include damages claimed by any person or organization for care, loss
of services or death resulting at any time from the "bodily injury".
2.  Exclusions 
This insurance does not apply to: 
a.  Expected Or Intended Injury 
"Bodily injury" or "property damage" expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured. This
exclusion does not apply to "bodily injury" resulting from the use of reasonable force to protect persons or
property. 
b.  Contractual Liability 
"Bodily injury" or "property damage" for which the insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of the
assumption of liability in a contract or agreement. This exclusion does not apply to liability for damages: 
1.  That the insured would have in the absence of the contract or agreement; or
2.  Assumed in a contract or agreement that is an "insured contract", provided the "bodily injury" or
"property damage" occurs subsequent to the execution of the contract or agreement. Solely for the
purposes of liability assumed in an "insured contract", reasonable attorney fees and necessary
litigation expenses incurred by or for a party other than an insured are deemed to be damages
because of "bodily injury" or "property damage", provided: 
a.  Liability to such party for, or for the cost of, that party's defense has also been assumed in
the same "insured contract"; and
b.  Such attorney fees and litigation expenses are for defense of that party against a civil or
alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which damages to which this insurance applies
are alleged.
c.  Liquor Liability 
"Bodily injury" or "property damage" for which any insured may be held liable by reason of: 
1.  Causing or contributing to the intoxication of any person;
2.  The furnishing of alcoholic beverages to a person under the legal drinking age or under the
influence of alcohol; or
3.  Any statute, ordinance or regulation relating to the sale, gift, distribution or use of alcoholic
beverages.
This exclusion applies only if you are in the business of manufacturing, distributing, selling, serving or
furnishing alcoholic beverages. 
d.  Workers' Compensation And Similar Laws 
Any obligation of the insured under a workers' compensation, disability benefits or unemployment
compensation law or any similar law. 
e.  Employer's Liability 
"Bodily injury" to: 
1.  An "employee" of the insured arising out of and in the course of: 
a.  Employment by the insured; or
b.  Performing duties related to the conduct of the insured's business; or
2.  The spouse, child, parent, brother or sister of that "employee" as a consequence of Paragraph (1)
above.
This exclusion applies whether the insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity
and to any obligation to share damages with or repay someone else who must pay damages
because of the injury. 
This exclusion does not apply to liability assumed by the insured under an "insured contract". 
f.  Pollution 
1.  "Bodily injury" or "property damage" arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge,
dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of "pollutants":

or rented or loaned to, any insured. However, this subparagraph does not apply to:

soot produced by or originating from equipment that is used to heat, cool or
dehumidify the building, or equipment that is used to heat water for personal use,
by the building's occupants or their guests;
ii.  "Bodily injury" or "property damage" for which you may be held liable, if you are a
contractor and the owner or lessee of such premises, site or location has been
added to your policy as an additional insured with respect to your ongoing
operations performed for that additional insured at that premises, site or location
and such premises, site or location is not and never was owned or occupied by, or
rented or loaned to, any insured, other than that additional insured; or

iii.  "Bodily injury" or "property damage" arising out of heat, smoke or fumes from a

b.  At or from any premises, site or location which is or was at any time used by or for any
insured or others for the handling, storage, disposal, processing or treatment of waste;
c.  Which are or were at any time transported, handled, stored, treated, disposed of, or
processed as waste by or for: 
i.  Any insured; or
ii.  Any person or organization for whom you may be legally responsible; or
d.  At or from any premises, site or location on which any insured or any contractors or
subcontractors working directly or indirectly on any insured's behalf are performing
operations if the "pollutants" are brought on or to the premises, site or location in
connection with such operations by such insured, contractor or subcontractor. However,
this subparagraph does not apply to: 
i.  "Bodily injury" or "property damage" arising out of the escape of fuels, lubricants or
other operating fluids which are needed to perform the normal electrical, hydraulic
or mechanical functions necessary for the operation of "mobile equipment" or its
parts, if such fuels, lubricants or other operating fluids escape from a vehicle part
designed to hold, store or receive them. This exception does not apply if the "bodily
injury" or "property damage" arises out of the intentional discharge, dispersal or
release of the fuels, lubricants or other operating fluids, or if such fuels, lubricants
or other operating fluids are brought on or to the premises, site or location with the
intent that they be discharged, dispersed or released as part of the operations
being performed by such insured, contractor or subcontractor;
ii.  "Bodily injury" or "property damage" sustained within a building and caused by the
release of gases, fumes or vapors from materials brought into that building in
connection with operations being performed by you or on your behalf by a
contractor or subcontractor; or
iii.  "Bodily injury" or "property damage" arising out of heat, smoke or fumes from a
"hostile fire".
e.  At or from any premises, site or location on which any insured or any contractors or
subcontractors working directly or indirectly on any insured's behalf are performing
operations if the operations are to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat,
detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of, "pollutants".
2.  Any loss, cost or expense arising out of any: 
a.  Request, demand, order or statutory or regulatory requirement that any insured or others
test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way
respond to, or assess the effects of, "pollutants"; or
b.  Claim or "suit" by or on behalf of a governmental authority for damages because of testing
for, monitoring, cleaning up, removing, containing, treating, detoxifying or neutralizing, or in
any way responding to, or assessing the effects of, "pollutants".
However, this paragraph does not apply to liability for damages because of "property damage" that
the insured would have in the absence of such request, demand, order or statutory or regulatory
requirement, or such claim or "suit" by or on behalf of a governmental authority. 
g.  Aircraft, Auto Or Watercraft 
"Bodily injury" or "property damage" arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to
others of any aircraft, "auto" or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured. Use
includes operation and "loading or unloading". 
This exclusion applies even if the claims against any insured allege negligence or other wrongdoing in the
supervision, hiring, employment, training or monitoring of others by that insured, if the "occurrence" which
caused the "bodily injury" or "property damage" involved the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment
to others of any aircraft, "auto" or watercraft that is owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any
insured. 
This exclusion does not apply to:

indemnitee in a contract or agreement that is an "insured contract";
b.  This insurance applies to such liability assumed by the insured;

period of less than 12 months, starting with the beginning of the policy period shown in the Declarations, unless the

period will be deemed part of the last preceding period for purposes of determining the Limits of Insurance.
SECTION IV - COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY CONDITIONS
1.  Bankruptcy 
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the insured's estate will not relieve us of our obligations under this
Coverage Part.

result in a claim. To the extent possible, notice should include:

which may be liable to the insured because of injury or damage to which this insurance may also
apply.
d.  No insured will, except at that insured's own cost, voluntarily make a payment, assume any obligation, or
incur any expense, other than for first aid, without our consent.
3.  Legal Action Against Us 
No person or organization has a right under this Coverage Part: 
a.  To join us as a party or otherwise bring us into a "suit" asking for damages from an insured; or
b.  To sue us on this Coverage Part unless all of its terms have been fully complied with.
A person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed settlement or on a final judgment against an
insured; but we will not be liable for damages that are not payable under the terms of this Coverage Part or that
are in excess of the applicable limit of insurance. An agreed settlement means a settlement and release of liability
signed by us, the insured and the claimant or the claimant's legal representative. 
4.  Other Insurance 
If other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under Coverages A or B of
this Coverage Part, our obligations are limited as follows: 
a.  Primary Insurance 
This insurance is primary except when Paragraph b. below applies. If this insurance is primary, our
obligations are not affected unless any of the other insurance is also primary. Then, we will share with all
that other insurance by the method described in Paragraph c. below. 
b.  Excess Insurance 
1.  This insurance is excess over: 
a.  Any of the other insurance, whether primary, excess, contingent or on any other basis:

coverage for "your work";
ii.  That is Fire insurance for premises rented to you or temporarily occupied by you
with permission of the owner;

the extent not subject to Exclusion g. of Section I - Coverage A - Bodily Injury And
Property Damage Liability.

the premises or operations, or the products and completed operations, for which you have

2.  When this insurance is excess, we will have no duty under Coverages A or B to defend the
insured against any "suit" if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that "suit". If
no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but we will be entitled to the insured's rights
against all those other insurers.
3.  When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount of
the loss, if any, that exceeds the sum of: 
a.  The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this
insurance; and
b.  The total of all deductible and self-insured amounts under all that other insurance.
4.  We will share the remaining loss, if any, with any other insurance that is not described in this
Excess Insurance provision and was not bought specifically to apply in excess of the Limits of
Insurance shown in the Declarations of this Coverage Part.
c.  Method Of Sharing 
If all of the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, we will follow this method also. Under
this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or
none of the loss remains, whichever comes first. 
If any of the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, we will contribute by limits.
Under this method, each insurer's share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the
total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers. 
5.  Premium Audit 
a.  We will compute all premiums for this Coverage Part in accordance with our rules and rates.
b.  Premium shown in this Coverage Part as advance premium is a deposit premium only. At the close of
each audit period we will compute the earned premium for that period and send notice to the first Named
Insured. The due date for audit and retrospective premiums is the date shown as the due date on the bill.
If the sum of the advance and audit premiums paid for the policy period is greater than the earned
premium, we will return the excess to the first Named Insured.
c.  The first Named Insured must keep records of the information we need for premium computation, and
send us copies at such times as we may request.
6.  Representations 
By accepting this policy, you agree: 
a.  The statements in the Declarations are accurate and complete;
b.  Those statements are based upon representations you made to us; and
c.  We have issued this policy in reliance upon your representations.
7.  Separation Of Insureds 
Except with respect to the Limits of Insurance, and any rights or duties specifically assigned in this Coverage Part
to the first Named Insured, this insurance applies: 
a.  As if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured; and
b.  Separately to each insured against whom claim is made or "suit" is brought.
8.  Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us 
If the insured has rights to recover all or part of any payment we have made under this Coverage Part, those
rights are transferred to us. The insured must do nothing after loss to impair them. At our request, the insured will
bring "suit" or transfer those rights to us and help us enforce them. 
9.  When We Do Not Renew 
If we decide not to renew this Coverage Part, we will mail or deliver to the first Named Insured shown in the
Declarations written notice of the nonrenewal not less than 30 days before the expiration date. 
If notice is mailed, proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice.

services) attributes such action, regardless of whether:
i.  the computer system, computer network, or electronic data is physically located within the
jurisdiction of that governing body; or
ii.  there are inconsistent statements within different branches or agencies of that governing body
(including intelligence, law enforcement, or military services) as to whom the action is attributable
to.
However, if:
A.  a governing body has not attributed any such action to a "state", or any person, group,
association, or entity acting on the "state's", behalf; and
B.  there is at least one "media report" or a cybersecurity forensic film report indicating that such
action is attributed to a "state" or any person, group, association, or entity acting on the "state's"
behalf,
then we will not pay any damages for "bodily injury", "property damage", or "personal and advertising
injury" resulting from any actions listed in parts a. through c. above until any governing body attributes
such action to a "state" or any person, group, association, or entity acting on the "state's" behalf.
If a governing body does not attribute such action to a "state" or any person, group, association, or entity
acting on the "state's" behalf, or declares it is unable to do so, then a "media report" or cybersecurity
forensic firm report will be conclusive evidence that the act was committed by, or on behalf of, a "state".
For purposes of this definition, "media report" means an article published by the Associated Press,
Reuters, Wall Street Journal, or the British Broadcasting Corporation.
For purposes of this definition, "state" means a sovereign state, state-like entity, quasi-state, proto-state,
or a state sponsored actor or group.
2.  "NCBR malicious act" means an act or series of acts that harms another person or damages property
through the physical release or dispersal of "nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological agents or
materials", which is carried out by any person or group of persons, whether acting alone, on behalf of, or
in connection with any organization.
3.  "Nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological agents or materials" means:
a.  nuclear reaction, nuclear radiation or radioactive particles, whether released or dispersed by
nuclear or conventional devices;
b.  any chemical compound; or
c.  any pathogen,
in sufficient concentration to cause harm to people or damage to property.

ECONOMIC AND TRADE SANCTIONS POLICYHOLDER NOTICE
Hiscox is committed to complying with the U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
requirements. OFAC administers and enforces economic sanctions policy based on Presidential declarations of national
emergency. OFAC has identified and listed numerous foreign agents, front organizations, terrorists, and narcotics
traffickers as Specially Designated Nationals (SDN's) and Blocked Persons. OFAC has also identified Sanctioned
Countries. A list of Specially Designated Nationals, Blocked Persons and Sanctioned Countries may be found on the

http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/.
Economic sanctions prohibit all United States citizens (including corporations and other entities) and permanent resident
aliens from engaging in transactions with Specially Designated Nationals, Blocked Persons and Sanctioned Countries.
Hiscox may not accept premium from or issue a policy to insure property of or make a claim payment to a Specially
Designated National or Blocked Person. Hiscox may not engage in business transactions with a Sanctioned Country.
A Specially Designated National or Blocked Person is any person who is determined as such by the Secretary of
Treasury.
A Sanctioned Country is any country that is the subject of trade or economic embargoes imposed by the laws or
regulations of the United States.
In accordance with laws and regulations of the United States concerning economic and trade embargoes, this policy may
be rendered void from its inception with respect to any term or condition of this policy that violates any laws or
regulations of the United States concerning economic and trade embargoes including, but not limited to the following: 
1.  Any insured under this Policy, or any person or entity claiming the benefits of such insured, who is or becomes a
Specially Designated National or Blocked Person or who is otherwise subject to US economic trade sanctions;
2.  Any claim or suit that is brought in a Sanctioned Country or by a Sanctioned Country government, where any
action in connection with such claim or suit is prohibited by US economic or trade sanctions;
3.  Any claim or suit that is brought by any Specially Designated National or Blocked Person or any person or entity
who is otherwise subject to US economic or trade sanctions;
4.  Property that is located in a Sanctioned Country or that is owned by, rented to or in the care, custody or control of
a Sanctioned Country government, where any activities related to such property are prohibited by US economic
or trade sanctions; or
